# Task 2:To Explore Supervised Machine Learning:
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
What we have to predict score if a student study for 9.25 hours in a day?
# Task-3: To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning:
In this task We have to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

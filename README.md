# THE SPARK-FOUNDATION-Internship
This repository contain all the tasks done by me during my internship with The Spark Foundation.
# Task 1 : To Improve Your Linkedln Profile:

# Task 2:To Explore Supervised Machine Learning:
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
What we have to predict score if a student study for 9.25 hours in a day?
# Task-3: To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning:
In this task We have to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
# Task-4 To Explore Decision Tree Algorithm:
For the given 'iris' dataset create a decision tree classifier and visualize it graphically.the purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier it would be able to predict right class accordingly.
# Task-5:To Explore Buisness Analytics and Performing Exploratory Data Analysis.
For the given superstore dataset we have to analyze and then taking decision like how we can increase our buisness growth and revenue in the future.
